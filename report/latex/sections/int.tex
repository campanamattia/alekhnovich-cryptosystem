In 2006, Clive Humby coined a slogan that has proven increasingly prescient over time: "Data is the new oil." Nothing could be truer in today's context. Much like any valuable resource, data has become a coveted asset, with individuals and entities vying to acquire and leverage it to their advantage. Consequently, from the outset, the need for secure communications and data protection was paramount.

Over the years, technological advancements have given rise to new algorithms and protocols designed to maximize data security. Tremendous strides have been made in safeguarding sensitive information, and yet, we find ourselves facing an imminent threat: the advent of quantum computers.

This threat to data security is not a hypothetical scenario; it is a reality on the horizon. Quantum computers, leveraging the principles of quantum mechanics, possess the potential to reshape the digital landscape by solving complex problems at unprecedented speeds. As we increasingly rely on digital communication and data storage for our most critical operations, the need for robust cryptographic defenses against quantum threats has never been more urgent.
